Before you publish a workbook that relies on an Analytics Extensions connection to Tableau Server, you should verify that the server is configured to be able to run scripts, and also configure Tableau Server to have its own Analytics Extensions connection. See "Configure Connection to Analytics Extensions" ([Windows](https://help.tableau.com/current/server/en-us/config_r_tabpy.htm) or [Linux](https://help.tableau.com/current/server-linux/en-us/config_r_tabpy.htm)) in the Tableau Server Help.

You cannot yet publish a workbook that contains analytics extensions scripting to Tableau Online.
