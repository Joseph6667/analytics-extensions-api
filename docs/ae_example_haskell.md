Tableau Zen Master, Tamás Földi, wrote an analytics extension to add Haskell programming language integration with Tableau. For more information, see his blog post [Tableau External Services API: Adding Haskell Expressions as Calculations](https://databoss.starschema.net/tableau-external-services-api-adding-haskell-calculations/). The GitHub repository for the project is: [https://github.com/tfoldi/tc19-haskell-ext/](https://github.com/tfoldi/tc19-haskell-ext/).
