Some examples of integrations built with this API are: 
- [TabPy](https://github.com/tableau/TabPy) - Execute Python code and saved Python functions in Tableau.
- [MATLAB integration](https://www.mathworks.com/products/reference-architectures/tableau.html) Use MATLAB models in Tableau visualizations.
- [Ople.ai ML predictive modeling](https://ople.ai/tableau-integration/) - Score data with predictive models built in Ople.ai
- [Haskell language integration](https://databoss.starschema.net/tableau-external-services-api-adding-haskell-calculations/) - Execute Haskell code in Tableau.
- [AltTabPy](https://alttabpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) - Simplified TabPy that executes Python code with no additional features.
- [Additional Tableau Functions](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/ext-api-test?path=README.md:1:0) - Example functions that can be added to Tableau calculations with the AE API.
- RapidMiner model invocation. - Integrate Rapidminer predictive models into Tableau visualizations.

Python via TabPy can also be used as a bridge to integrate Tableau with other technologies, using it as a middle layer to communicate with other services such as, Amazon SageMaker, Algorithmia, and DataRobot.
