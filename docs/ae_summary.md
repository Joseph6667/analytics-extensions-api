- [MATLAB integration](https://www.mathworks.com/products/reference-architectures/tableau.html)
- [Ople.ai ML predictive modeling](https://ople.ai/tableau-integration/)
- [Haskell language integration](https://databoss.starschema.net/tableau-external-services-api-adding-haskell-calculations/) 
- [AltTabPy](https://alttabpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
- [Additional Tableau Functions](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/ext-api-test?path=README.md:1:0)

Python via TabPy can also be used as a bridge to integrate Tableau with other technologies, using it as a middle layer to communicate with other services such as, Amazon SageMaker, Algorithmia, and DataRobot.
