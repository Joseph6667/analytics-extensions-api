One of the core scenarios for Analytics Extensions is the integration of predictive models into Tableau visualizations. Dynamic integrations allow for real-time predictions on the latest data, flexible scenario testing, and predictions on filtered datasets that would be too large to pre-compute. A good example of this is the integration with [ople.ai](https://ople.ai/tableau-integration/).
