Tableau Developer Advocate, Keshia Rose, created an example analytics extension to demonstrate how to create a server that can communicate with third-party APIs. It shows you how to use the Analytics Extensions API to do things like convert money from one currency to another and how to convert dates to strings based on a specified format. For more information, see [the project on Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/ext-api-test?path=README.md:1:0).
