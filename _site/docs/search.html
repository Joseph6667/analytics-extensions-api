TabPy is an open source project so you can see the implementation and documentation at https://github.com/tableau/TabPy. Using TabPy to Cluster Tornado Origins Here is an example of a workbook in Tableau Desktop that tracks tornado origin points in the USA to find areas where tornadoes are tightly clustered together. It uses the TabPy Analytics Extension to dynamically cluster the data using Python code. The Python code is inserted into a SCRIPT tag in the calculation for the Groups measure. It is being run dynamically as a calculated field and is being executed on a TabPy server and returned back to Tableau. To view the script, right-click the Groups measure and click Edit. The script is enclosed in a SCRIPT_STR block. It is passed the latitude and longitude of origin points of tornadoes. In this TabPy integration, you can change the data being fed into the calculation dynamically using filtering in the viz and you can change the parameters that are being fed into the model. The Python code and analytical clustering model are updated and recalculated in real time just like any calculated field but it’s being done in Python outside of Tableau."

You can do advanced analysis such as forecasting, classification, simulation, all from inside a Tableau visualization. The directness of the integration means that it’s all dynamic. As people ask new questions and come up with new scenarios that they want to test or as new data comes in, they can see the latest results. Use Tableau Server to share dashboards or visualizations that call extensions code. You communicate with external services from Tableau through table calculations called SCRIPT functions. They are computed on the visual level of detail in the visualization where you’re using them. The script calculations are: SCRIPT_REAL, SCRIPT_INTEGER, SCRIPT_STRING, and SCRIPT_BOOLEAN. They tell Tableau what data type to expect as a result from the analytics extension. Script calculations allow you to write code or identify external functions in Tableau, pass data out, use it in the code or function in your analytics extension, and then return the results back. You can pass both aggregate dimensions and measures and parameters from Tableau into the script. For more information, refer to the blog post Working with External Services in Tableau: Python, R, and MATLAB."

Analytics extensions can receive data from Tableau in real time and return it back after it has been scored, transformed, or augmented. Note: If you are looking for the Tableau Dashboard Extensions API, see the Tableau Dashboard Extensions API documentation. The Analytics Extensions API is based on the Python integration for Tableau, TabPy, which allows you to call Python functions directly from Tableau. The API that was used originally for TabPy has been expanded to make it more generalizable to any external analytics engine. Previously, analytics extensions were known as external services. To use the API, you don’t need to install anything new in Tableau. You just need your analytics extension implementation and Tableau Desktop or Tableau Server."
